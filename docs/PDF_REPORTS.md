4. **Local Storage** ‚Üí PDF is saved in `reports/` directory

### Schedule

- **9:00 AM** Sri Lanka Time (GitHub Actions)

After each scan, you'll receive:
1. üìß Regular email notification with activity details
2. üì± Mobile push notification (if configured)

## Configuration

### Requirements

Already included in `requirements.txt`:
- `reportlab==4.0.7` - PDF generation
- `Pillow==10.1.0` - Image handling

### Email Setup

Same email configuration used for regular notifications:

```bash
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=recipient@example.com
```

## PDF Styling

### Design Elements

- **Colors**: Gradient purple/blue theme matching dashboard
- **Tables**: Professional with alternating row colors
- **Typography**: Clean Helvetica font
- **Layout**: Letter size (8.5" √ó 11")

### File Naming

Reports are named with timestamp:
```
LMS_Report_20251006_093000.pdf
```

Format: `LMS_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pdf`

## Manual Generation

You can also generate reports manually by running:

```bash
python pdf_report.py
```

This will:
1. Connect to the database
2. Gather latest activities and deadlines
3. Generate PDF in `reports/` directory
4. Show the file path

## File Locations

- **Generated PDFs**: `reports/LMS_Report_*.pdf`
- **Generator Code**: `pdf_report.py`
- **Email Integration**: `notifier.py` (send_email_with_pdf method)

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Generated

**Check**:
1. Dependencies installed: `pip install reportlab Pillow`
2. `reports/` directory exists (auto-created)
3. Database has activities/deadlines

### Email Not Received

**Check**:
1. Email configuration in `.env`
2. Gmail App Password (not regular password)
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify PDF file exists in `reports/`

### PDF Looks Broken

**Solution**:
- Update dependencies: `pip install --upgrade reportlab Pillow`

- Ensure data in database is valid
