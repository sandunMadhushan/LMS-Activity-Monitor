# 🎉 Your LMS Activity Monitor is Ready!

## What You Have Now

I've created a **complete, production-ready system** to monitor your Moodle LMS accounts and notify you about new activities. Here's what's included:

## 📦 Complete System Components

### 1. **Core Scraping Engine** (`scraper.py`)

- Automated login to both OUSL and Rajarata University Moodle
- Discovers all your enrolled courses
- Extracts every activity (assignments, quizzes, resources, etc.)
- Detects new additions since last scan
- Runs with or without visible browser

### 2. **Database System** (`database.py`)

- SQLite database to track everything
- Stores courses, activities, scan history
- Identifies what's new vs. what you've already seen
- Maintains notification history

### 3. **Email Notification System** (`notifier.py`)

- Beautiful HTML emails with all new activities
- Includes deadlines, descriptions, and direct links
- Grouped by university for clarity
- Professional formatting

### 4. **Web Dashboard** (`app.py` + templates)

- Modern, responsive web interface
- View all courses from both universities
- Browse activities with filtering
- Statistics and scan history
- Manual scan triggers
- Test email functionality

### 5. **GitHub Actions Automation** (`.github/workflows/monitor.yml`)

- Runs automatically twice per day (9 AM & 9 PM)
- No server needed - uses GitHub's infrastructure
- Completely free with GitHub account
- Secure credential storage

### 6. **Documentation**

- `README.md` - Project overview
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Complete architecture details
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command cheat sheet

### 7. **Helper Scripts**

- `start.bat` - Windows quick start
- `start.sh` - Linux/Mac quick start
- `test_setup.py` - System verification

## 🚀 Next Steps (Getting Started)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed
python --version

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Credentials (10 minutes)

1. **Create your `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your information:**

   - Your OUSL username and password
   - Your Rajarata username and password
   - Your Gmail address
   - Gmail App Password (see setup guide)

3. **Get Gmail App Password:**
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification
   - Create App Password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password to `.env`

### Step 3: Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test your setup
python test_setup.py

# Send a test email
python scraper.py --test-email

# Run a test scan (with visible browser)
python scraper.py --headless False
```

### Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions (15 minutes)

1. **Create GitHub repository:**

   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository "lms-scraper"
   - Make it private (to protect your credentials)

2. **Push your code:**

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - LMS Activity Monitor"
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Add GitHub Secrets:**

   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these 7 secrets:
     - `OUSL_USERNAME`
     - `OUSL_PASSWORD`
     - `RJTA_USERNAME`
     - `RJTA_PASSWORD`
     - `EMAIL_SENDER`
     - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
     - `EMAIL_RECIPIENT`

4. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Enable workflows
   - Manually trigger first run to test

### Step 5: Enjoy! ✨

The system will now:

- ✅ Check both Moodle sites twice daily (9 AM & 9 PM)
- ✅ Email you about any new activities
- ✅ Track everything in a database
- ✅ Keep a history of all scans

## 🎯 How It Works

```
Every 12 hours (9 AM & 9 PM):
  │
  ├─► Login to OUSL Moodle
  │   ├─► Find all your courses
  │   ├─► Extract all activities
  │   └─► Save to database
  │
  ├─► Login to Rajarata Moodle
  │   ├─► Find all your courses
  │   ├─► Extract all activities
  │   └─► Save to database
  │
  ├─► Compare with previous scan
  │   └─► Identify new activities
  │
  └─► If new activities found:
      ├─► Format beautiful HTML email
      ├─► Send notification
      └─► Mark as notified
```

## 📧 What Email Notifications Look Like

## 🌐 Web Dashboard Features

Run locally: `python app.py` → Visit http://localhost:5000

### Dashboard Page

- Quick stats (total courses, activities, new items)
- Recent activities timeline
- Scan history
- Manual scan button
- Test email button

### Courses Page

- View all enrolled courses
- Filter by university (OUSL/RJTA)
- See last checked time
- Direct links to Moodle

### Activities Page

- Chronological list of all activities
- New items highlighted
- Filter by date/course
- Direct links to activities

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. First Scan Will Show Everything as "New"

This is normal! The first scan has nothing to compare against. After that, only genuinely new items will be flagged.

### 2. Adjust Timing for Your Timezone

Edit `.github/workflows/monitor.yml` to change scan times:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 3 * * *" # 9 AM Sri Lanka Time
  - cron: "0 15 * * *" # 9 PM Sri Lanka Time
```

### 3. Run Manual Scans Anytime

- From web dashboard: Click "Run Scan Now"
- From terminal: `python scraper.py`
- From GitHub: Actions → Run workflow

### 4. View Detailed Logs

- Local runs: Console output
- GitHub Actions: Actions tab → Select run → View logs

### 5. Keep Database History

The `lms_data.db` file contains all your history. Back it up occasionally!

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

✅ **Secure:** Your credentials are encrypted as GitHub Secrets  
✅ **Private:** No third parties involved  
✅ **Local:** Database stored on your machine or GitHub (private repo)  
✅ **Safe:** Passwords never appear in logs or code  
✅ **Standard:** Uses official Moodle login (no hacks)

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Login Issues?

```bash
# Run with visible browser to see what's happening
python scraper.py --headless False
```

### Email Not Working?

```bash
# Test email configuration
python scraper.py --test-email
```

### Setup Problems?

```bash
# Run system check
python test_setup.py
```

### GitHub Actions Failing?

- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Verify all 7 secrets are configured
- Ensure secret values don't have extra spaces
