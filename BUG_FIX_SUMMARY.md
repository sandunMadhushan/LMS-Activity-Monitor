# PDF Report Bug Fix - October 8, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Issue**: PDF report was showing "0 new activities detected" even when the system correctly identified and sent text/email notifications about new activities.

**Example**:
- Text notification: "You have 2 new activities" ✅
- PDF report: "0 new activities detected" ❌

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The bug was caused by an **incorrect execution order** in `scraper.py`:

### Original (Buggy) Flow:
```python
1. Get new activities from database (is_new=1)
2. Send text/email notifications
3. Mark activities as notified (is_new=0)  ← Activities marked here
4. Generate PDF report
5. Try to get new activities again (returns empty because is_new=0) ← Bug!
```

### The Problem:
The `get_new_activities()` method only returns activities where `is_new = 1`. After step 3, all activities were marked as `is_new = 0`, so step 5 returned an empty list for the PDF report.

## ✅ Solution

Reordered the execution to generate the PDF **BEFORE** marking activities as notified:

### Fixed Flow:
```python
1. Get new activities from database (is_new=1)
2. Generate PDF report (using activities with is_new=1) ✅
3. Send PDF via email
4. Send text/email notifications
5. Mark activities as notified (is_new=0)
```

## 📝 Code Changes

**File**: `scraper.py` (Lines 955-997)

**Key Changes**:
- Moved PDF generation before `mark_activities_as_notified()`
- Reused the same `new_activities` list for both PDF and text notifications
- Ensured both notifications use the same data source

## 🧪 Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:

1. **Before Fix**: PDF showed 0 activities even when 2 were detected
2. **After Fix**: PDF will correctly show all new activities

Next automated scan will verify the fix in production.

## 📊 Impact

- ✅ PDF reports will now correctly include all new activities
- ✅ No data loss - all activities are still tracked correctly
- ✅ Execution order is more logical and maintainable
- ✅ Both text and PDF notifications use the same data
